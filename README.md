## Introduction
Unlike the Machine Learning course on Coursera, this nanodegree is an intensive intermediate/advanced level course in this field. It contains multiple courses in Udacity, including [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120), [Machine Learning by Georgia Tech](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning--ud262), [Reinforcement Learning by Georgia Tech](https://www.udacity.com/course/reinforcement-learning--ud600),  [Deep Learning by Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730)

## What I want to say 

For me, the majority of this nanodegree's content is pretty familiar. Most of them is covered by the Machine Learning course online or at school. Therefore, I think of this nanodegree as a opportunity to systemtically review the fundementals and new tools in the machine learning field. 

For clarity, for each project I created its own README file, where I've included a concise outline and the important visualization of specific project. I did this at the hope of anyone who's viewing my work can have a clear and intuitive understanding of what I have done and how did I get the final result. 

## finding-donors

This project utilizes supervised learning methods, it aims to predict who's
more likely to donate to a charity organization given the U.S. census data. 

## customer-segments

This project focuses on unsupervised learning method. It tries to segment customers of 
a whole sale distributor into different groups, and finds the hidden relationship of features within each group. Based on the
analysis, we would be able to give valuable advice to the distributor with regard to the change of their delievery policy.
