## Introduction
Unlike the Machine Learning course on Coursera, this nanodegree is an intensive intermediate/advanced level course in this field. It contains multiple courses in Udacity, including [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120), [Machine Learning by Georgia Tech](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning--ud262), [Reinforcement Learning by Georgia Tech](https://www.udacity.com/course/reinforcement-learning--ud600),  [Deep Learning by Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730)

## What I want to say 

For me, the majority of this nanodegree's content is pretty familiar. Most of them is covered by the Machine Learning course online or at school. Therefore, I think of this nanodegree as a opportunity to systemtically review the fundementals and new tools in the machine learning field. 

For each required project I created its own README file  in addition to the source code, where I've included a concise outline and the important visualization of specific project. **I did this at the hope of anyone who's viewing my work can have a clear and intuitive understanding of what I have done and how did I get the final result.** And for optional or introductory project, source codes are uploaded.
