# Machine-Learning-Applications

The algorithms and applications that we implemented are listed below.
In each folder, there is a README file demonstring the implementation step by step.
I tried to make it as clear as possible so that you can understand what we have done. Besides, I also included some 
**visualization** to make it more intuitive to understand. 

Feel free to make pull request if you found any mistake.

## finding-donors

This project utilizes supervised learning methods, it aims to predict who's
more likely to donate to a charity organization given the U.S. census data. 

## customer-segments

This project focuses on unsupervised learning method. It tries to segment customers of 
a whole sale distributor into different groups, and finds the hidden relationship of features within each group. Based on the
analysis, we would be able to give valuable advice to the distributor with regard to the change of their delievery policy.
